# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:

### Step 1: 
import math
### Step 2: 
Write the function to find the distance
### Step 3: 
Get the inputs
### Step 4:
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](./formula.JPG)
### Step 5:
 End the program

### PROGRAM:
```python

import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
